# Project Submission

Welcome to my project submission! Below are the details for running both the frontend and backend, along with instructions for accessing the admin panel.

## Frontend

- The frontend is fully developed, including animations.
- To run the frontend locally, use the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- You can manage the **Work** and **Services** sections by accessing the admin panel at `/admin`. Make sure to create the necessary data for these sections.

## Backend

- To run the backend locally, use the following command:

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

## Admin Login

Use the following credentials to log into the admin panel:

- **Email**: `admin@example.com`
- **Password**: `password`

## Note

Due to time constraints, I was only able to implement the **Work** and **Services** sections of the CMS. 

Thank you for reviewing my submission!
